# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ModelReflect is a Roblox plugin which lets users reflect the selected objects in 3d space. It has two
operations, either clicking a plane to reflect the selection over that plane, or clicking a flip button
to reflect the object through its pivot one one of the primary axis.
It outputs a `.rbxmx` plugin file built via Rojo.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the plugin (default build task)
rojo build -p "ModelReflect V2.0.rbxmx"

# Run tests (*.spec.lua files in the Src folder)
python runtests.py

# Install dependencies
wally install
```

Tools are managed via Aftman (`aftman.toml`): Rojo 7.6.1. Dependencies are managed via Wally (`wally.toml`).

## Architecture

Three-layer design:

1. **Functionality layer** — Scene manipulation, handle rendering, ghost previews, final placement.
   - `src/createModelReflectSession.lua` — Session lifecycle: creates/updates/commits duplicated geometry, manages undo waypoints.
   - `src/doReflect.lua` — Reflect a given set of objects over a given plane in place (modifying them).
   - `src/Dragger/` — 3D handle implementations (Move, Rotate, Scale) built on DraggerFramework.
   - `src/TestTypes.lua` — Types definition of the testing framework, spec files take in a type from here.

2. **Settings layer** — Persistent configuration that the functionality layer reads.
   - `src/Settings.lua` — Reads/writes plugin settings, exposes current configuration state.

3. **UI layer** — React components that modify settings and trigger operations.
   - `src/ModelReflectGui.lua` — Main settings panel (React).
   - `src/PluginGui/` — Reusable UI components (NumberInput, Vector3Input, Checkbox, ChipToggle, etc.).

**Entry point:** `loader.server.lua` creates the toolbar button and dock widget, then lazy-loads `src/main.lua` on first activation. `src/main.lua` orchestrates the three layers — it listens for selection changes, manages the active model refect session, and mounts the React UI.

## Key Conventions

- All source files use `--!strict` (Luau strict type checking) and many use `--!native` (native codegen).
- Types are defined with `export type` and collected in `src/PluginGui/Types.lua` for UI-related types.
- React components use `React.createElement` (aliased as `e`) — not JSX.
- The Signal library (`Packages.Signal`) is used for custom events throughout.
- Modules typically `return` a single function (e.g., `createModelReflectSession`, `doReflect`) rather than a table of exports.
- Undo/redo integrates with `ChangeHistoryService` using recording-based waypoints

## Dependencies (via Wally)

- **React / ReactRoblox / RoactCompat** — UI framework
- **DraggerFramework / DraggerSchemaCore** — 3D handle/manipulator system (authored by stravant)
- **Signal (GoodSignal)** — Event system
- **createSharedToolbar** — Optional toolbar combining with other plugins
